# GopherCheck

A concurrent Chess AI written in Go!

GopherCheck is a work in progress and currently supports a subset of the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol.  To use GopherCheck, you'll need a UCI-compatible chess GUI.

GopherCheck currently supports fixed time-per-move games.  I'll be adding support for time-per-game and fixed-ply soon.
