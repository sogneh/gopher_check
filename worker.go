// Each worker maintains a list of active split points for which it is responsible.

// When a worker's search reaches a new SP node, it creates a new SP struct, (including the current
// []Stack info) and adds the SP to its active SP list.

// When workers are idle (they've finished searching and have no split points of their own),
// they request more work from the load balancer. The load balancer selects the best
// available SP and assigns the worker to the SP.

// The assigned worker begins a search rooted at the chosen SP node. Each worker searching the SP
// node requests moves from the SP node's move generator.
