Debugging:



To Do:

Add ability to accurately evaluate promotions via see()


Implement Late-Move Reductions.

Separate out hashable elements of pawn evaluation (elements that don't depend on pieces other than pawns).

Implement Pawn Hashtable.  Update Make/Unmake.

Implement Draw By Threefold Repetition using linked lists

Implement hashtable-based Principal Variation Search

Implement Internal Iterative Deepening.


Ideas:

Disable boundary checking on compile?  Could improve execution speed significantly given the amount of 
array access.  Only do this once engine is finalized and thoroughly debugged.
