Debugging:

Rare TT bug where entry is for the wrong color.


To Do:

Add separate check generator to Q-Search

Add separate QSearch and Hashtable -based sorting at root nodes.

Implement Principal Variation Search

Implement Late-Move Reductions.

Implement Pondering.

Improve Pawn Evaluation - 
  Rebalance bonuses, improve handling of pawn promotion.
  Separate out hashable elements of pawn evaluation (elements that depend only on other pawns).
  Implement Pawn Hashtable.  Update Make/Unmake.

Improve king saftey


Ideas:

Disable boundary checking on compile?  Could improve execution speed significantly given the amount of 
array access.  Only do this once engine is finalized and thoroughly debugged.
