Killer Move Heuristic


To Do:

Use check extensions only after the first check.

Add separate QSearch and Hashtable -based sorting at root nodes.

Implement Principal Variation Search

Add ability to accurately evaluate promotions via see().

Implement Pondering.

Implement Late-Move Reductions.

Improve Pawn Evaluation - Rebalance bonuses, improve handling of pawn promotion.
Separate out hashable elements of pawn evaluation (elements that depend only on other pawns).
Implement Pawn Hashtable.  Update Make/Unmake.

Implement Draw By Threefold Repetition using linked lists




Ideas:

Disable boundary checking on compile?  Could improve execution speed significantly given the amount of 
array access.  Only do this once engine is finalized and thoroughly debugged.
